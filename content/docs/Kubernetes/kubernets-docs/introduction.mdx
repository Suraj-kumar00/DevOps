# Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Developed by:** Google  
**Donated to:** Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2015  
**Written in:** Go (Golang)

## Why Was Kubernetes Created?

Before Kubernetes, managing containers manually was difficult, especially in large-scale production systems. Containers would run, but features like auto-recovery, scaling, and service discovery were missing.

Kubernetes was created to solve the following problems:

- Manual container deployment was slow and error-prone
- No built-in fault tolerance or self-healing
- Scaling containers across servers was complex
- Rolling updates required manual work
- Service discovery and load balancing were hard to manage

Kubernetes solves these by:

- Automatically scheduling containers across nodes
- Handling failures (self-healing, restarts)
- Managing scaling, updates, and desired state
- Enabling declarative infrastructure through YAML

## Why Use Kubernetes Instead of Just Docker?

Docker is great for building and running containers, but it lacks orchestration features. Kubernetes builds on Docker by managing container lifecycle at scale.

| Feature                              | Docker     | Kubernetes |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Container creation                   | ✅         | ✅         |
| Networking between containers        | 🟡 Limited | ✅         |
| Auto-scaling                         | ❌         | ✅         |
| Load balancing                       | ❌         | ✅         |
| Self-healing                         | ❌         | ✅         |
| Rolling updates                      | ❌         | ✅         |
| Orchestration (multi-container apps) | ❌         | ✅         |
| Declarative YAML config              | ❌         | ✅         |

## Conclusion

Docker sirf ek chhota part hai (container runtime). Kubernetes us container ko manage karta hai — production-ready orchestration system.

## Disadvantages of Kubernetes

- **Complexity:** Learning curve is steep, especially for beginners.
- **Resource Intensive:** Needs more system resources (not ideal for small projects).
- **Setup Time:** Initial setup (especially on-premise) can be time-consuming.
- **Overhead:** For small apps, it can feel like overkill.
- **Debugging:** Troubleshooting issues in pods, networking, and volumes can be difficult.

## What is YAML?

YAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human-readable, declarative data format mainly used for configuration.

In Kubernetes, we use YAML to define:

- Pods
- Deployments
- Services
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Ingress, and more…

YAML lets you declare the desired state of resources. Kubernetes then tries to make that state real.

## Why YAML is Used in Kubernetes?

- ✅ **Human-readable:** Easy to read and write
- ✅ **Declarative:** You describe what you want, not how
- ✅ **Widely adopted:** Supported by Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker Compose, etc.
- ✅ **Version-controlled:** Easy to use in Git repositories
- ✅ **Portable:** Works across environments (local, staging, prod)

## Basic YAML Syntax Rules

- **Indentation:** Always use spaces, not tabs. Usually 2 spaces.
- **Case-sensitive:** Name ≠ name. Stick to lowercase keys.
- **Key-value pairs:** Use key: value format
- **Lists:** Use - (dash) followed by a space for list items
- **String quoting:** Wrap special characters (@, #, etc.) in quotes
- **Start of a YAML doc:** Use --- (3 dashes) to indicate start of YAML file

## Example of a Simple YAML (Kubernetes Pod)

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1 # API version used for the resource type (v1 for core objects like Pod)
kind: Pod # Type of Kubernetes object you're creating (here, it's a Pod)
metadata: # Metadata contains data like the name of the resource
  name: my-first-pod # Name of the pod (must be unique within the namespace)
spec: # Specification of the pod — this defines what the pod will do
  containers: # A list (array) of containers that will run inside this pod
    - name: my-container # Name of the container (your custom name)
      image: nginx:latest # Docker image to be used for the container (from Docker Hub)
      ports: # Ports that this container will expose
        - containerPort: 80 # The port number the container listens on (like HTTP on port 80)
```

## Tips

- Use **YAML Lint** to check for syntax errors.
- Always validate with `kubectl apply -f file.yaml --dry-run=client`.
- Keep your indentation consistent (2 spaces recommended).
- Avoid trailing spaces or tabs — they break the file silently.
